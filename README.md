## MLOps v2 Lab

In this workshop, we provided both CLI and SDK exercise. You can choose your preferred option. The exercise starts from ml-pipeline folder. 

There are 3 labs in this workshop, with an optional lab4:

## Lab 1. Building a training pipeline. It can be a custom model pipeline or automl pipeline.
  - Experiment with notebooks in `notebooks` folder to explore data and model 
  - Update .env.sample and fill the respective subscription, resource group and workspace values. Rename file to .env. 
  - Build pipeline by navigating to `ml-pipelines` and run ml-pipelines\sdk\train-sdkv2.ipynb
  - Review components of the pipeline and fill in missing parts and references 
  - Once pipeline is run, Model will be trained and registered in the WS registry

## Lab 2. Building a deployment pipeline, it could either be an online endpoint or batch endpoint. 
  - Deploy Model by navigating to `ml-pipelines` and running corresponding notebooks for batch deployment ml-pipelines\sdk\deploy-batch-endpoint-sdkv2.ipynb or online deployment ml-pipelines\sdk\deploy-online-endpoint-sdkv2.ipynb

## Lab 3. CICD

The following steps show how to run the model training and deployment pipeline via Azure devops pipelines using Azure ML Cli extension. For simulating the same flow with  SDKv2, we jump to step 3.2.

#### 3.1a Set up Azure DevOps Repository

1. Verify/Update the resource names, service connection names in ./config-infra-dev.yml and ./config-infra-prod.yml files.
2. Create an organization(if not already there) in Azure DevOps and add a project
3. Initialize a Git repository and clone it to your local machine
4. Add this code to your repository:

```powershell
# Initialize git repository (if not already done)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Create and switch to dev branch
git checkout -b dev

# Push to remote repository (replace with your repository URL)
git remote add origin <your-repository-url>   OR
git remote set-url origin <your-repository-url>
git push -u origin dev
```
#### 3.1b Set up Variable Groups
In Azure DevOps , Within **Project** Go to Library inside Pipelines. Create variable groups DevVars and ProdVars with the following variables:
- resource_group
- workspace_name

#### 3.1c Create Azure DevOps Pipelines
To set up the CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps:
1. In Azure DevOps, navigate to **Pipelines** in the left sidebar
2. Click on **New pipeline**
3. Select **Azure Repos Git** as your code repository source
4. Select your repository from the list
5. Choose **Existing Azure Pipelines YAML file**
6. Select the branch (typically `dev` or `main`)
7. In the path dropdown, select one of the following pipeline files:
   - `/devops-pipelines/deploy-model-training-pipeline.yml` (for model training)
   - `/devops-pipelines/deploy-batch-endpoint-pipeline.yml` (for batch endpoint)
   - `/devops-pipelines/deploy-online-endpoint-pipeline.yml` (for online endpoint)
8. Click **Continue**
9. Review the pipeline YAML file. Check the agent-pool name and update as needed .
10. Click **Run** to save and run the pipeline, or **Save** to just save it
Repeat these steps for each pipeline you want to create. You'll typically want to set up the model training pipeline first, followed by the endpoint deployment pipelines.


#### 3.2 Deploying via the SDKv2
1. We don't have a devops-pipeline yml created for this workshop ; but it can be easily created by modifying the yml and adding a python or powershell task to run the python script ml-pipelines/sdk/run_pipeline.py
2. You can test it locally by running the following command from your VS code powershell terminal.
```
python ml-pipelines/sdk/run_pipeline.py `
                   --experiment_name taxi-train-pipeline `
                   --compute_name cpu-cluster `
                   --data_name taxi-data@latest `
                   --environment_name taxi-train-env `
                   --enable_monitoring false `
                   --table_name taximonitoring
```


## CI/CD Pipeline Workflow
### Development Workflow
1. Create feature branches from `dev` branch
2. Make changes and push to the feature branch
3. Create a pull request to merge into `dev`
4. After PR approval, merge to `dev` which triggers the dev pipeline
5. Resources are deployed to the dev environment
### Production Deployment
1. Create a pull request from `dev` to `main`
2. After thorough testing and PR approval, merge to `main`
3. This triggers the production pipeline and deploys to the production environment




## Lab 4. Working with AML Registries (Optional Lab)

1. Please follow the steps mentioned here to create a registry , https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-manage-registries?view=azureml-api-2&tabs=cli
2. For trying out working with registries ; The code example are based on the nyc_taxi_data_regression sample in the examples repository. To use these files on your development environment,  clone the repository and change directories to the example and  navigate to following notebook tohttps://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/assets/assets-in-registry/share-data-using-registry.ipynb to test how to register data assets to shared registry between workspaces
3. For Sharing Model components , use https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/assets/assets-in-registry/share-models-components-environments.ipynb
